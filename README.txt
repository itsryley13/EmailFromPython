# EmailFromPython
A Script I Wrote That Sends Emails To People From A Basic Terminal Interface!
Hello
Basically You run the script
Then it will ask for gmail OR outlook(can use hotmail with outlook option too)
then...

it asks for an email to send a message to,
then asks for your email and password.
then it will send the email...

simple enough aha !

Thank you...
